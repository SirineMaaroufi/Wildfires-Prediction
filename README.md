# Wildfires-Prediction
### Predict wildfires occurrence using Machine Learning 

Predict wildfire occurrence based on 3 features:
* NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
* LST: Land surface temperature
* Burned Area

To do so, I tried 2 diferent algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression. 
SVM had a better performance based on the performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix and classification report.

* IDE: Jupyter Notebook
* Language: Python 3
* Libraries: Pandas/ Matplotlib/ Scikit-learn/ imblearn.
* Dataset Description: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/85t28npyv7/1
* Date: April 2022
